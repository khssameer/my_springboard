Capstone Project 1 : Predict Gold Rates - Final Project
-----------------------------------------------------
Historically, gold had been used as a form of currency in various parts of the world including USA. 
In present times, precious metals like gold are held with central banks of all countries to guarantee re-payment of foreign debts, and also to control inflation which results in reflecting the financial strength of the country.
Forecasting rise and fall in the daily gold rates, can help investors to decide when to buy (or sell) the commodity.
In this project would forecast gold rates using the most comprehensive set of features and would apply various machine learning algorithms for forecasting and compare their results.
We also identify the attributes that highly influence the gold rates.


Below are the steps I would perform to predict the Gold Rates using Python Libraries

1. Fetching the Gold Rates Data.
2. Analyze and describe the Data.
3. Data Wrangling
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Finalizing the indicators variables and the Dataset.
6. Final problem statement.
7. Normalizing the data
8. Test Train Split Data
9. Building Models
10. Compare the model performance Parameters.
11. Final Project report.
